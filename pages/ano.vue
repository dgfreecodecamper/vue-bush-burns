this is a **sentance** in ~~the~~ 'text' *how* __cool__ is this 

other [I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com) here 

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```
 
```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```
 
```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. 
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```
Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are                | Cool  |
| ------------- |:------------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned      | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered           |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat           |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3
