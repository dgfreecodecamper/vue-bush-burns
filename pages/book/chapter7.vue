# Social Changes - Poverty & Deprivation

History is about people rather than events. Not only did our church buildings and forms of worship change, but our people’s lifestyles changed and it is awe-inspiring to discover how our forefathers faced the deprivations of poor housing, ill health, poverty and lack of education or work prospects, not to mention the political and religious strife which has already been described.

Poverty was rampant and this led to alcoholism and ill health, so all the churches, together with charitable people and organisations tried to find ways of dealing with it. This is illustrated by the fact that some prominent people left endowments for the relief of hardship among the poor. The following endowments for ‘the poor of Glendermott’ were bequeathed.

‘By Colonel Mitchelbourne £86 to put an interest to pay 3d a week to 8 poor inhabitants. £67 to pay £4 per annum to the schoolmaster for teaching 12 poor children of the Church of England. £25  to pay 1 shilling yearly to 30 people on the tombstone of Colonel Mitchelbourne and £146 to give each Sunday half a peck of oatmeal to 16 poor, after the Sermon.’

In 1742 Alex Tomkins left £50, ‘interest to be given yearly to 6 poor widows’ and in 1751 Alderman William Stanley left £42 to give 20 barrels of oatmeal shelling yearly to the poor.

This hand to mouth existence continued right into the nineteenth century. The Ordinance Survey Memoirs of Ireland 1831 – 1838 informs us that 57% of the families in Glendermott were totally dependent on agriculture and when harvests were poor then people died. Two particularly bad years were 1816 and 1817 when many people died through destitution. Most of the farms were under 20 acres, so they were too small to be profitable. Many tenant farmers, having planted their fields in potatoes and some oats for their own use, headed off to Scotland and England to take labouring jobs until harvest time. This enabled them to pay their rents and look after their families.

Proximity to the port in Derry facilitated trade in eggs and butter to Scotland and England. This provided important additional household income and was very often in female hands.

There was a variety of local manufacturing industries in operation – two tanneries, a brewery at Drumahoe owned by Francis Horner which produced 1,000 barrels of beer annually, a distillery in the Waterside, seven flax mills and six corn mills using water power from the Faughan, a spade mill in Ardkill, a plough manufactory at Lisnagelvin, a tree nursery at Knockbrack and an important bleach green at Ardmore where 48 men and 12 boys were employed mostly bleaching the coarse grades of linen.

Some people had began hand spinning at home but this was made unprofitable by the fact that mills in England had machines which spun thread more cheaply. However weaving was still important in local households.

To relieve some of the health problems a dispensary described as ‘a neat slated building’ was erected in 1832 costing 50 pounds 6 shillings – this sum being raised by subscription. This dispensary which stood at the foot of the Church Brae, within the grounds of Second Glendermott, gave advice and medicines to those who needed it.

In 1822 or 1824, a Poor Shop was opened. It was located in the vestry room of Second Glendermott. The O.S. Memoirs recorded that the Shop’s takings for 1 year was £282 12s 9d. The items sold that year were : ‘106 pairs of blankets, 345 shirts, 278 shifts, 189 petticoats, 176 gowns, 82 waistcoats, 91 pairs of trousers, 15 counterpanes, 10 cloaks, 18 beds, 11 bolsters, 91 aprons, 87 pairs of shoes, 68 sheets, 56 shawls, 16 caps’ – totalling 1641 items.

# People's Dress

Men usually wore coarse linen trousers and Scottish lowland caps. Clothing was mostly bought from pawn-brokers and second-hand shops. The garments of the abject poor were frequently patched until every trace of the original stuff had disappeared.

A complete dress for a female when the materials were bought at the shop, cost about £1 3s 0d. It would last about two years by repeated patching and darning.

Some unfortunate members of Glendermott had so little to live on, that they were unable to attend church, simply because they couldn’t afford the clothes which they felt they required to appear at public worship. The Session seemed to have acknowledged their difficulty, because according to First Glendermott’s Session Minutes of 1844, the Session decided that in some cases where people wanted to come to church but couldn’t afford clothes, that instead of the Session giving money, it should ‘provide articles of dress as they seem most to require and which shall enable them to make a decent appearance among their fellow worshippers.’

Of course the Church offered financial help to those who most needed it. Glendermott Kirk Session met each quarter with sometimes no other business but to ‘distribute Poor’s Money.’ This money had been donated by Charitable Societies and by bequests. A typical example of this aspect of the Session’s business can be seen from the First Glendermott Kirk Session Minutes, dated 7th November, 1844, where the following item is recorded:

The London Guilds (Grocers and Goldsmiths Companies) and the Irish Society also subscribed to the Dispensary and to the schools in the neighbourhood.

# Education

The first type of education in the area was provided by the Hedge Schools – where children were taught, not in proper school buildings, but along hedges, behind walls or in old barns. The teachers moved from area to area and were hired by parents.

By 1821, according to the O.S. Memoirs, not more than 80 children were attending schools. However as more schools began to open all over the parish, being paid for by the parents and organised by the various churches, this figure rose steeply to 836 in 1834, taught by 16 teachers. Some of the early schools were described as ‘thatched cabins.’ The school for Drumahoe was established in 1825. The O.S. Memoirs record for the school says it was: ‘a small slated house, income 1 pound: physical instruction – none; intellectual instruction – Dublin Reading books, geography etc.; moral instruction; Mr Radcliffe and the Reverend Messrs Monteith and Carson visit, Authorised Version; number of pupils: males 20 under 10 years; females 25 under 10 years, 5 pupils from 10 to 15. Total 30: Total number of pupils 50 , 48 Presbyterian, 1 Roman Catholic, 1 other denomination Mistress Isabella Mills, Presbyterian.’

The Rev William Monteith of First Glendermott and the Rev Henry Carson of Second Glendermott were obviously the managers of the school. The Rev Carson’s name appears elsewhere when the school later requested monetary help.

# The Great Famine 1846 - 49

This disaster which struck Ireland also affected Glendermott. In 1846 blight struck the potato crop in the district. The effects of this tragedy were profound and many people were forced to emigrate mainly to U.S.A., Canada and Australia. It is recorded in the book ‘In the Shadow of the Tail of the Fox,’ that the poor and the needy were regularly fed at a soup kitchen, which the locals had established in Greerstown. The food served consisted of soup and oaten bannocks. When the famine had run its course about 1849, the organising committee had £100 left and the interest was given to the poor people for the most of a century afterwards. The capital was finally divided between Glendermott and Magheramason Presbyterian Churches.

It wasn’t until 1838, when the Irish Poor Law Act was introduced that the government made any effort to relieve poverty. As a result of this the Waterside Workhouse opened in November 1840, with a capacity for 800 inmates. The first inmates were mainly beggars, although begging still continued for many years to come.

Life and work in the Workhouse was harsh with a view to encouraging inmates to leave as soon as possible. It was also degrading – families were split up as males and females were separated. The Great Famine increased the number of inmates to 973 in December 1847 and remained high with still 692 inmates in January 1850.

However some of the burden which had been borne by the Churches and other voluntary bodies, was now being shouldered by the government which was of great help.

# Health Problems

Another deprivation which made life difficult for our forefathers was the lack of medicine and expertise to deal with illnesses which today would be easily cured with modern drugs, but were life-threatening in these earlier times. One of the most dreaded diseases and which was infectious, was tuberculosis, or consumption as it was commonly called. This disease continued to take its toll for many years and right up until the middle of the twentieth century, people were falling victims to this wasting disease. During the Rev Wylie’s ministry, one family lost three young children of Sunday School age in one week – the memory of this tragedy still remains with some of our older members.

Throughout all these struggles against these social ills, the Church in Glendermott stood by its people ministering to their social and economic requirements as well as its spiritual needs. There was therefore a great sense of dependency on the church and the Minister and Session were held in high esteem. This showed in the efforts people made to attend worship, considering the distances some of them had to travel on foot, by bicycle or in some cases ponies and traps.

The church provided stables beside the sexton’s house. These stables later became a Session room, a ladies’ room and a store. The horses or ponies were unhitched from the trap and led in to the stable. The empty traps remained in what is now a car park.

Some of those who walked long distances, knew short-cuts, which forced them to walk through fields or rough terrain. For instance those who lived along the Trench Road area found it convenient in letter weather, to walk down the fields which led to Church Road, or the Lower Road as it was called formerly. In order to preserve their footwear, they wore rough shoes or boots and then changed in to decent footwear when they got to the road.

# People's Dress

In more recent times, from the 1920’s and 30’s onwards, people had more money and so they dressed their best for Sunday services. These were the days of the ‘Sunday Go To Meeting Suits.’ They were worn for years, having kept carefully in the wardrobe at home with the aid of moth-balls to prevent the moths from damaging the fabric. These dark coloured suits were worn only on Sundays or special occasions such as funerals and weddings. Men’s suits usually had waistcoats which allowed the more affluent to wear a pocket watch with a gold chain – a sure mark of respectability.

The ladies and younger girls also wore fairly sombre clothes. It was customary for ladies when old enough to be grandmothers to dress in black. All the females wore hats to church and even in the Rev Park’s time, some ladies still wore the old bonnets which were tied underneath the chin.

In the 1940’s and 1950’s – ladies became more fashion conscious and there was much more money available to spend on clothes. It was then that the Spring Communion Service and the Harvest Thanksgiving Service were occasions when the ladies appeared in new Spring or Autumn outfits – quite a fashion parade!

Judging by our fashion in the 1950’s, our congregation seemed as if we had two kinds of members. There were those who traditionally still wore the navy-blue suits and starched shirts, whereas there were the younger members who had begun to dress like the film stars of the day. The congregation was also changing from being a rural one, with most members coming from an agricultural background living in the country areas, to a more urban industrial background, with many members now living in the new modern housing estates which were springing up in the Waterside. The car was also becoming more affordable to the working man and that of course provided a major change in the people’s lives and life-styles.
