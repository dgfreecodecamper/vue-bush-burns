# The Development of Glendermott Congregation

It is against this background that the history of Glendermott Presbyterian Church must be reviewed. It is one of the oldest Presbyterian congregations in Ireland. All the families in the Parishes of Glendermott (Clondermott), Donagheady, Cumber and Faughanvale were at one time connected with it. Since its organisation into a settled charge in 1654, no less than twelve Presbyterian congregations have been planted in the district which was once ministered to by our first minister the Rev John Will.

Eight of these congregations formed its own Presbytery – Glendermott Presbytery – in 1834. These eight congregations and the year in which their establishment is recorded are: Glendermott (established 1654), Donagheady (1658), Faughanvale (1696), Cumber (1717), Banagher (1755), Donemana (1798) Upper Cumber (1828), Gortnessy (1841).

As part of a reorganisation of Presbyteries, Glendermott Presbytery united with Limavady Presbytery to form the Foyle Presbytery on 4th January 1962.

# The First Minister - John Will 1654 - 1679

The first settled minister of Glendermott of which there is any record was Mr John Will (or Wool ), M.A., who was ordained here in 1654, in the days of the Commonwealth. At this time Mr Will seems to have been the only minister of religion in the Parish and his Church was within the walls of the old graveyard. In a list in the Office of Records, Dublin Castle, 1655, it is stated that John Will, Clandermount, received from the ‘Civil Establishment of the Commonwealth £80 per annum.’ After the restoration of Charles II he was ejected by the Bishop of Derry and a warrant for his arrest was issued in November 1661 to answer before the Lord Justices ‘such matters as may be objected against him.’ Yet it was not until 1665 that a Government Order was made that he should surrender the Parsonage House to George Holland, Dean of Derry, ‘from whom he detains them, or else appear and show cause.’ It is hardly surprising that this action was taken by the Bishop of Derry. After all John Will had refused to conform to the Established Church, so he could no longer be permitted to preach in a Church of Ireland Church. However when he did go, he took the majority of the congregation with him, since they were Presbyterians.

The fact that Mr Will was the parish minister of Glendermott in the time of the Commonwealth and in possession of the parsonage for at least five years after the Restoration of Charles II, explains a matter which has long been an enigma. There are in existence at the present time, three Communion Tankards, the property of the congregation of Glendermott. On each of these there is engraved a cross with I.H.S. and the nails. It is not known how the congregation came to possess these ancient communion vessels. Three explanations have been suggested. One is that they originally came from Columbkill’s Monastery in Clooney, which was destroyed about the time the Glendermott congregation was organised. Another is that some of the settlers brought them from Scotland. And a third, which is now believed to be the correct one, is that they came to the congregation with Mr Will who had been the parish minister.

# Glendermott in Mr Will's time

‘The Civil Survey of 1654’ presents a picture of what the Parish of Glendermott was like then, when Mr Will began his ministry and what a wretched picture it is.

‘There is little of eminence or note remarkable in this Barony (of Tirkeeran), it being totally destroyed and laid waste during the first year of the wars in Ireland. There remains the ruins of the two castles and villages belonging to the Londonders, one in the parish of Faughanvale built by the company of Grocers on their Manor or proportion, the other in the parish of Clondermott within the Liberties of Derry, built by the Company of Goldsmiths on their Manor or proportion (at Newbuildings, then called Goldsmiths town). The river of Faughan runs through a great part of the Barony, beginning in the parish of Cumber from thence through part of the parish of Glendermott in to Loughfoyle. There are many good fords and passes on said river, but with great rain, these are made unpassable which often happened to the destruction of many travellers for want of a bridge. There are many rivulets in the said Barony, but of no note worth describing. The land is generally mountainous and boggy, save only some valleys along the Faughan water and along the Lough. The grain it bears is altogether oats, save some little quantity of wheat and summer barley gained of land forced with dung.’

The ejection of Mr Will from the Parish Church left the Presbyterians of Glendermott without a place of worship. There were 60 other Presbyterian ministers besides Mr Will who refused to conform and then also deprived of somewhere to live and preach. The following extract from Adairs Narrative p.257 shows how Mr Will and these other ministers faced this desperate situation.

‘The Ministers generally took themselves to the houses they had formerly of their own, or had lately built in the several parishes; and judged it their duty, as for as it was possible, to stay among the people and to take such opportunities for their edification as the times could permit; partly conversing with them singly in private and partly gathering them at convenient times in small companies and exhorting them from the Word. They resolved to go about their duty with as great prudence as they could – considering they had many adversaries and watchful eyes upon them and not a few to represent them as disloyal and rebellious persons if any grounds had been given. They thought it more suitable to their case and more profitable to their flocks to do somewhat among them in a private way without noise or alarming the magistrates and thus continue among the people, than to appear publicly in preaching in the fields which could have lasted but a very short time and would have deprived them of the opportunity of ordinarily residing among the people – which in the case of some who took another course came to pass.’

So these ruthless measures subsequently taken against Presbyterians prevented them erecting new churches and it was not until about 1668 that a less rigorous policy enabled them to build Meeting Houses here and there. It is not probable that any Presbyterian Church building existed in Glendermott before the Commonwealth Period and it is not likely that any such building was erected in years immediately after 1660. It may have been about 1668, therefore that the first Meeting House was built. This structure would probably have had a thatched roof and an earthen floor. It was situated near the road between the present church and the old graveyard. Some have suggested that it was approximately a quarter of a mile from the present church. It was not a prominent building. The exact site has never been confirmed but traces of its ruins are said to have been visible in the latter half of the nineteenth century.

For nearly fifty years, it served the needs of the congregation, but because of its limited size, it proved insufficient for an expanding area. Accordingly the present church was erected in 1696. It was built to last, by men whose vision was not bounded by their own generation. Its original walls are still intact and it is one of the oldest buildings in connection with the Presbyterian Church in Ireland.

John Will did not live to see the new church. In 1679 he was old and infirm and on the advice of Presbytery, he resigned the oversight of the congregation.

# James Tailzior (Taylor) 1680-1683 

One year afterwards, James Tailzior was installed as minister. He had come from the North of Scotland to Ireland in 1675 and had been ordained by the Laggan Presbytery at St. Johnston to Monea, Enniskillen and Derryvallen. In April 1679 he was imprisoned and fined at Enniskillen for acting as a minister. He was interested in the art of healing and in July 1680 his people complained of ‘his frequent absence in practice of Physic.’ The Laggan Presbytery then promptly forbade him to practise medicine. He resigned and in August 1680 he was installed as minister of Glendermott, where he laboured for three years when he accepted a charge in Forfarshire, Scotland. There is no account of Mr Tailzior’s installation in Glendermott, but this is accounted for when we know that at this time installations were often dispensed with and some ordinations were held in private houses. Mr Tailzior seems to have been a popular preacher as at the time he was a candidate for Glendermott, three other congregations sought his services. After returning to Scotland, Mr Tailzior took part in the rebellion against James II, was present at the Battle of Killiecrankie in 1689 and died in 1694. An interesting example of the fall in the purchasing power of money is shown by the fact that, in his Call to Glendermott, the annual amount of Stipend promised him, was thirty pounds.

# James Gordon 1683-1692

The third minister was James Gordon, also from Scotland. After his arrival in Ireland he took services, for some time, in a disused Meeting House at Bovevagh, but was instituted in Glendermott in 1683. He is chiefly remembered in connection with the Siege of Derry in 1688-89. It was Mr Gordon who urged the Apprentice Boys of Derry to close the gates of their city against Alexander McDonnell, Earl of Antrim, and his regiment of ‘red-shanks’ from the Highlands of Scotland and the Glens of Antrim. The Rev John MacKenzie, who was the Presbyterian Chaplain to Governor Walkers regiment during the Siege, in ‘A Narrative of the Siege of Londonderry,’ published in 1690 says – ‘Alderman Tomkins consulted Mr Gordon, a Non-Conformist minister, what was expedient to be done, who not only advised the shutting of the gates, but wrote that day to several neighbouring parishes, to put themselves in a posture for assisting the city.’ In a ‘Life of William III’ by John Ryan, M.R.S.L. it is said ‘One of the Aldermen, named Tomkins, consulted the Rev James Gordon, a dissenting clergyman, who advised the shutting of the gates and wrote to several of the neighbouring parishes for assistance.’ And Dr Jas. S Reid in a ‘History of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland’ Vol. II says – ‘The Rev James Gordon, Presbyterian minister of Clandermott, a parish adjoining Derry, advised the inhabitants to shut the gates and exclude the obnoxious regiment from the garrison. On this sudden and apparently unimportant movement.’ Reid says – ‘the fate of the three kingdoms ultimately depended. Had Derry been occupied by a popish garrison, the armies of James would have possessed the whole of Ulster and thence passed without obstruction into Scotland, where united to the forces of Claverhouse, Viscount Dundee, they would have made an easy conquest of that Kingdom and afterwards invaded England with accumulated strength.’
The Protestants of Derry and its hinterland, had already been following anxiously certain developments in Ireland since James II had succeeded Charles II. Catholics had been replacing Protestants in prominent positions of power. Then Colonel Richard Talbot, a leading Catholic, was made Lieutenant General of the army in 1686 and given the title of Earl of Tyrconnell. He began reorganising the army – replacing Protestant officers by Catholics, so when the Earl of Antrim arrived at Londonderry on the 7th December 1688, the city was full of anxious Protestants who had fled from all over the county to seek protection from the garrison within the city walls.

The Apprentices closed the gates to prevent any entry by the Earl of Antrim’s army, although this decision was opposed strongly by Dr Ezekiel Hopkins, the Bishop of Derry at that time. It was at noon that the gates were shut and soon afterwards the Bishop came down to the Diamond and made a speech to the multitude, in which he warned them of the dangerous consequences that would follow their mad act. In reference to that speech, Lord Macauley says – ‘The Bishop expostulated in vain. It is indeed, possible that the vehement and daring young Scotsmen, who had taken the land on this occasion had little respect for his office. One of them broke in on a discourse with which he interrupted the military preparations by exclaiming – ‘A good sermon, my Lord, a very good sermon, but we have not time to hear you now.’

# James Gordon and the relief of the City

It was the Rev James Gordon, who as Woodrow, the indefatigable historian of ‘The Sufferings of the Church of Scotland,’ informs us, urged Kirk to attempt the breaking of the boom which prevented the ships from carrying food to the famishing garrison and had this attempt been delayed for two days longer, it would have been too late. It is said that Gordon found his way to Kirk’s ship and drafted for him a plan of the part of the river which opens on Rosses Bay, across which the boom was placed. This he would have been well able to do, being a minister of Glendermott and personally acquainted with the locality. Captain Browning also persuaded Kirk to venture, so Kirk yielded. Captain Browning’s ship, the Mountjoy, went up first and broke the boom but he himself was killed. Macauley says – ‘A shot from one of the batteries struck him and he died one of the most enviable of all deaths in sight of the city, which was his birthplace, which was his home and which had just been saved by his courage and self-devotion from the most fearful form of destruction.’

After the Relief of Derry, to which Gordon had contributed so much, he retired to Scotland and became Minister of the Parish of Cardross, on the Clyde near Dumbarton, whence by letter to the Lagan Presbytery, in January 1692, he demitted the charge of Glendermott. He died at Cardross not long after.

# Colonel Adam Murray

Glendermott also claims another siege hero, Colonel Adam Murray of Ling in Cumber. His membership of the Presbyterian Church has been disputed, but it is extremely difficult to explain many features and episodes of the career on any other hypothesis. At the very beginning of the Siege, Lundy and the Council sent for the Presbyterian ministers of the city to get them to persuade Murray to consent to surrender. Why send for them if he was not a Presbyterian? An Adam Murray attended the Laggan Presbytery as an Elder from Glendermott in 1674 and 1676. The language of the letter sent to the Fleet from Murray, Cairns and Gledstanes is Presbyterian in its religious terms and flavour.

Adam Murray is justly entitled to be forever regarded as the Hero and General of the Siege of Derry and the real author of that ‘No Surrender’ policy which has made Derry famous for all time. In every sortee and battle which took place, Col Adam Murray was at the head of his troops. He was involved in all the garrison’s battles outside the walls, especially the battle of Pennyburn, where the French General De Maumont fell to Col Murray’s sword .

He was descended from Murrays of Philippaugh in Selkirkshire, Scotland and there can be no doubt that he was, previous to the Siege of Derry, an Elder in the congregation of Glendermott. Little is known of the later life of Murray. According to Burke and Young, Colonel Adam Murray died in 1700, but there is no contemporary evidence.

A plain flat stone with the following inscription marks his grave in the old cemetery:

<div class="text-center">
    ‘The Grace of the Murrays<br>
    Descendants of Col. Adam Murray<br>
    Who Distinguished Himself by His Bravery<br>
    During the Siege of Londonderry<br>
    A.D. 1688<br>
    His Remains Rest Beneath This Plain Stone’<br><br>
</div>

At the east end of this flat stone there is a square obelisk surmounted by a marble urn. The inscription thereon is as follows:

<div class="text-center">
    ‘In Memory of Colonel Adam Murray of Ling<br>
    in this County<br>
    Who During the ever Memorable Siege of Derry<br>
    1688<br>
    Led to the Relief of that City<br>
    A Troop of Horse which He had Raised<br>
    For its Defence and who<br>
    Eminently Distinguished Himself by His Skill<br>
    And Bravery during that eventful Struggle for<br>
    Civil and Religious Liberty'<br><br>
</div>

This monument was erected over his grave by the Honourable the Irish Society AD 1837.’

An iron railing surrounds the grave. There are inscriptions in memory of the last male descendants of Colonel Murray.

Close beside it is the grave of his fellow soldier, Governor Mitchelbourne.

After the Siege of Derry was over, the people of Glendermott suffered at the hands of the Jacobite army who vented their fury on them as they passed through the valley, such was their frustration. They burnt the Ivy Church where John Will had preached, the castle and most of the village of Newbuildings and also some of the large houses such as Beechill. However, the parish settled to relative peace, although it wasn’t until 1696 that a minister was installed to replace the Rev Gordon.

# John Harvey 1696-1739

The Rev James Gordon as we have seen, demitted his charge in 1692 and was succeeded in March 1696 by the Rev John Harvey who came from New Abbey in Scotland. His father was minister of Dunmore, Co. Donegal. John Harvey was educated in Scotland and was a licentiate of the Laggan Presbytery. He had been ordained in Dumfries in 1691, but in September 1695 resigned on being called to Glendermott. He was promised a Stipend of forty pounds, ‘some corn and also to build a House for him even though Cumber and Muff (another name for Faughanvale), should fall off and not join them.’

To give some idea of the value of money about this period it has only to be stated that three months before the Siege of Derry, a salmon two feet long could be bought for two pence, 45 eggs for a penny, a fat goose for three pence, a fat turkey for six pence, a fat hen for three half pence and a fat kid or lamb for four pence. Remember also that one pound was worth two hundred and forty pence.

The present church building which is a standing witness to the numbers, the wealth and the influence of the Presbyterian inhabitants of the district, was built in 1696, at the beginning of John Harvey’s ministry. His son, David Harvey M.A., was ordained his assistant in 1731, but resigned in 1737 on receiving a call from First Derry, where he laboured until his death in 1794.

The Rev John Harvey died in 1739 and his death was followed by a long vacancy.

# The Congregation is divided

After Mr Harvey’s death there was great dissension in Glendermott. The harmony, which had been maintained since the far-off beginning of the congregation’s life, was broken and the congregation was much divided over the choice of a new minister to succeed Mr Harvey.

Commissioners in support of different candidates to fill the vacancy appeared again and again not only before the Presbytery but also before the Synod. At a meeting of the Synod at Dungannon on June 16th 1741, there appeared from Glendermott, William Bond and John Thompson, with a Commission ‘from the greater part of the Session and some part of the Congregation,’ asking the Synod to send them supplies (i.e. ministers). In opposition to this, Robert Hall and George Brown ‘produced a Commission signed by 302 hands, representing the lesser part of the Session but by far the greater part of the Congregation.’

Their view was that the congregation had grown too large for one man and so they proposed that a collegiate charge should be established – that is a church served by two ministers. They therefore petitioned to have the Rev John Cochran, a native of Carndonagh and the Rev William Haire, settled amongst them. They also were apparently dissatisfied with the Presbytery of Derry and asked to be disannexed from it and placed under the care of the Presbytery of Letterkenny.

The both parties having been heard, the matter was remitted to the Presbytery of Derry with assessors from the Presbyteries of Coleraine, Letterkenny and Strabane. In 1742 William Bond appeared before the Synod to oppose the settlement of John Cochran and William Haire; and Robert Hall and other Commissioners appeared saying that as Mr Cochran had declined the invitation of the Congregation and as 376 heads of families were in favour of Mr Haire, as appeared from the Committee of the Derry Presbytery, they were anxious that the ‘Synod would order Mr Haire’s settlement among them, in an ordinary way, and that he be appointed their constant supplier in the meantime.’ This was referred to a Committee of Synod, which passed several resolutions, the second of which was – ‘That the Presbytery of Derry be advised to try ye ability of the minor partie and if they find them capable to maintain a minister, they shall have power to erect them.’ This resolution was adopted by the Synod and finally carried out by the Presbytery of Derry. So because the minority still couldn’t agree to call Mr Haire and were capable of supporting a minister of their own, the Derry Presbytery bowed to the inevitable and agreed to the erection of a second congregation. Accordingly the Rev William Haire, a native of Faughanvale and a licentiate of the Derry Presbytery, was ordained in what was now called First Glendermott in March 1743.

The new congregation, Second Glendermott, called the Rev John Holmes and he was ordained in 1744. This congregation erected a new church, near the crossroads at the bottom of Church Brae. It had two galleries and was built to hold 350 persons.

From this time the churches were known as First Glendermott and Second Glendermott.
