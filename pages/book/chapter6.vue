# Changes in our form of Worship

The service of worship followed a similar pattern to that of today but it lasted much longer in earlier years.

The Authorised Version of the bible was the only translation used for many years. The Rev McWhirter introduced the Revised Standard Version during his ministry and pew bibles were provided for the first time. Then in the Rev Patterson’s ministry the New International Version was adopted and new N.I.V. pew bibles replaced the R.S.V. copies.

The way in which we praise God has changed considerably over the years. Up until the 1900’s, the congregation sang mostly psalms and paraphrases and the singing was unaccompanied. The praise was led by a Precentor who, with the help of a tuning fork, started off the singing. As he was relied upon to lead the choir and congregation, he therefore had to be carefully chosen. An example of this can be seen when in 1851, First Glendermott had to find a replacement for their Precentor who had retired. The Session Minutes recorded that those who were interested in the vacant position had to sing on ‘Two Lord’s Days on Trial.’ One Elder objected to a certain candidate. He said he heard the man sing on four Lord’s Days in the congregation and he considered that ‘he could not lead an assembly with any degree of regularity.’ However the congregation seemed to be pleased enough with him, as they appointed him.

# Instrumental Music Issue

In 1872 there was a dispute which affected every congregation in the General Assembly, namely the question of Instrumental Music. As the Assembly discussed the possibility of introducing instruments in to our worship, there was fierce division in the country at large and it seems that Glendermott also hotly disputed the issues.

The Reverend Thomas Thompson and the Kirk Session and Committee of First Glendermott met on the 19th August 1872 and unanimously adopted the following resolution:

‘That, Instrumental Music having been introduced in to our Church and the question having been raised at the last meeting of Assembly and an attempt made to legalize this innovation, which although then unsuccessful, is still pending, we consider it to be the duty of the Presbyterian people to take immediate action, in order to prevent such innovations in any and every congregation in connexion with their Church.

That Instrumental Music, being contrary to the practice of the Church and highly offensive to a large majority of the Presbyterian people and not being essential to Christian Worship, is, consequently, in direct opposition to the Spirit and teaching of God’s Word. And , believing that its introduction into our Church will work incalculable mischief and should its promoters be successful in carrying out their object, not only will the revenues of the Church be seriously impaired, but the Church itself will be divided, we consider that an opportunity should be afforded to the members of this congregation to express their opinion on this most serious and important question.

That, in order to afford this opportunity, a Congregational Meeting be held on Sabbath, the First of September next, immediately after public worship and that notice thereof be given from the pulpit on the Sabbath previous.’

At the congregational meeting it was unanimously agreed that Instrumental Music would be resisted. Four resolutions were passed.

‘That the resolutions adopted by our Session and Committee at their late meeting, disapproving of the use of instruments in the worship of God in our Church and affording us, as a congregation, this opportunity of expressing our views on a question in which the interests of the Church are so involved, have our most hearty approval.

That, embracing the opportunity afforded us, we, as a Congregation do hereby protest against any and every form of Worship, ‘not prescribed in the Holy Scriptures’ and we further protest against any departure from, or any innovation in, the form of worship practised by our Presbyterian forefathers, which, we believe, was in accordance with the mind and will of the Divine Being, whom they worshipped and who is the ‘same yesterday, today and forever.’

That, irrespective of the question whether Instrumental Music in the worship of God is or is not lawful in itself, the fact that it is not essential to Christian Worship and is offensive to the brethren, renders it not only unlawful, but highly sinful. We, therefore, cannot admit the liberty claimed by its advocates – a liberty, which under the circumstances, is not recognised, but is most emphatically condemned, in God’s Word.

That we, accordingly, condemn and testify against the use of Instrumental Music in the worship of God in any Congregation in connexion with our Church and we hereby resolve to resist, by every lawful means in our power and to co-operate with our brethren throughout the Church, in resisting this and every innovation that has not a Divine warrant.’

Second Glendermott congregation was equally opposed to the proposed innovations and their minister Dr Corkey, wrote a pamphlet entitled, ‘Shall We Discard The Psalms,’ in which he pointed out that the proposed new Church Hymnary expressed sentiments which were not in harmony with the teaching of the Presbyterian Church. These Criticisms were acknowledged by the General Assembly, resulting in the production of a Revised Edition of the Church Hymnary. This was introduced to Second Glendermott in May 1887. When it came into popular use, it was usually followed in most cases by the introduction of an organ – the assembly left this matter to the discretion of each congregation.

Another factor which helped sway many Ministers, were the visits of Moody and Sankey, the famous American evangelists. They introduced their popular gospel hymns to crowded meetings which convinced Ministers that there was a need to use more hymns and instrumental music to attract and hold the younger members of their congregations.

# The First Organ to be used in Glendermott 

However it was not until the reunification of the two congregations that the first organ was introduced. In March 1931 the Session of First and Second Glendermott approved the purchase of an organ and a Mr William Lewis was appointed organist and choirmaster in May 1931. He must have been a very capable organist as Glendermott Presbyterian Church Choir won 1st Prize at Coleraine Music Festival in April 1933.

In February 1939, Miss Mary Duncan was appointed organist, although a male organist had been advertised for. Then in November 1943 Mrs Muriel Hamilton became organist.

After her resignation, Mrs Maisie Watson became organist and remained so for over 40 years, retiring in 1984. After Mrs Watson retired, Mr Billy Taggart was appointed and then Mr Stewart Smith. Since Mr Smith, the congregation has been unable to appoint a permanent replacement and Miss Laura Kenwell has been playing for the past year.

# Changes in the Communion Service

Another aspect of our worship - that of celebrating the Lord’s Supper, has also changed from earlier times. Instead of the small glass individual cups which we use for the wine nowadays, large goblets were passed around in earlier days. There were four tankards and six goblets belonging to First Glendermott and two tankards and five goblets from Second Glendermott. Wine was passed from the tankard to the goblets which were handed from person to person. Each person drank from this Common Cup and passed to the next person. Those who have experienced this system felt it was unhygienic.

In 1931, the Girls Auxiliary ( the organisation which preceded the Presbyterian Women’s Association) presented the first individual glasses to the congregation, in memory of the late Rev Park who had passed away in 1930.

Another change in the Communion Service was in the type of wine which was used. Up until 1890 this wine was alcoholic, which militated against the Church’s anti-alcohol teaching. In the late 19th Century there was a great Temperance Movement in the Church, one of its main proponents being Dr Joseph Corkey of Second Glendermott. Temperance was being taught through the Band of Hope and the Sunday Schools were expected to place emphasis on the dangers of strong drink. Each communicant was invited to sign a pledge before taking their first communion and each congregation was expected to preach at least one sermon on Temperance each year. Presbyterians kept constant watch on the granting of licences and often objected to certain premises being granted a licence to sell alcohol. Therefore it is no wonder that the Church decided to change the communion wine to the non-alcoholic type which is used today.

Yet another change was made to the way in which people were invited to the Communion Service. Nowadays this invitation comes in the form of a card which is disposed of at the end of the Communion Season and another one is issued at the next Communion. In the past, however, each congregation had its own special metal token, which was collected after each Communion Service and used again. They were given to those who intended to participate on the weekend before Communion Sunday.

The following is a extract from an article by William Barnett, on early Communion tokens:

‘Church historians tell us that Communion tokens are first mentioned in Geneva in 1560. John Calvin was in favour of introducing the practice there ‘as a safeguard from having the Lord’s Table profaned by the unworthy’, but the first record we have of their use is by the Reformed Church in France. The thinking was that the minister and elders would decide, after examination, who was worthy to receive a token, your admittance to a place at the table. John Knox brought the idea back with him to Scotland from Geneva and the custom spread to wherever Presbyterianism took root, including of course Ireland.

The early tokens are made of lead and most later examples usually a mixture of lead and tin, called ‘white metal’. Occasionally they are made of brass or copper and only rarely are other metals or materials used. They come in various sizes and shapes, oval, oblong, square and round being the most common.

The earliest known token we have of Glendermott, with the letters ‘GD’ for Glendermott, is dated 1729 [Fig. 1 below]. Little doubt but earlier tokens existed, perhaps as in some other congregations, just small unmarked pieces of lead. There is also a token of Second Congregation dated 1744, with the letters ‘G/N.E’ to represent Glendermott New Erection [Fig.2]. there are four other tokens of First Glendermott, one with ‘GD’ on one side only [Fig.3]; one with 1819 on the reverse side [Fig.4];another dated 1837 on reverse [Fig.5], and one oval token reading ‘First Presbyterian Church Glendermot’ [Fig.6]. Finally, an oval token with ‘Second Presbyterian Congregation Glendermott’ [Fig.7]; both these oval tokens has a common reverse [Fig.8] and would have been in use just prior to the introduction of the card.’
