# Acknowledgements

Our congregation was established in 1654, so in order to celebrate 350 years of witness in Glendermott, many special events have been arranged for 2004. As part of this celebration, I was asked to write a brief history of the congregation.

Many of our congregationâ€™s Session Minute Books for the early years have been lost, so much of our history is difficult to find, but I have been greatly helped by previous histories which were produced in 1923 and 1954 and by many people who provided me with their own snippets of knowledge and who also produced newspaper cuttings, old photographs, documents, letters and other items.

I would especially like to express my gratitude to the Rev. Patterson, to Basil Craig who provided me with recent photographs and sketch drawings and to my daughter, Heather Glenn, who had the onerous task of typing out my script to facilitate the publishers.

Ryan Donaghey.
