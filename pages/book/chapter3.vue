# Glendermott and the Second World War

Many homes were affected by the 1939-45 war. Many young men belonging to the church had gone away to fight, leaving behind anxious relatives.

The ladies of the congregation were being asked to help the ‘war effort’ by providing food parcels. Some people found it hard enough to feed their families because of food rationing and so generally it was an anxious time when people waited for bad news, listened to ominous radio broadcasts and watched the gas filled balloons being hoisted over the American radio-facility stations nearby – thus increasing their expectancy of a German bombing raid on the area.

The American navy had set up a camp in Beechill and  the church had frequent visits by groups of young American ‘CB’s’, who were brought to the church for morning service. They would sit dressed in their uniforms at the front of the main aisle and were warmly welcomed by the members of congregation who sometimes invited them for tea.

The church felt they had to provide a social occasion for them to attend. One of these occasions came in the form of a ‘Boxed Tea Event’ – where a female had to make up a meal for two people. Each meal was auctioned and the servicemen were expected to take part in the auction. If their bid was successful, they were allowed to partake of the meal along with whoever had made up the box. This auction was followed by a social evening with music and games. It is said that not everyone approved of the ‘Boxed Tea’ idea.

The American servicemen also came to the badminton which was very popular then – the hall being used al least twice a week.

The Rev Wylie who was minister during the War was also heavily involved in the Home Guard, which was the local defence force. In 1943 he was asked to act as Chaplain in the Navy. As this would have been a full-time appointment, he asked the Session for leave of absence, but they were reluctant to release him as they felt he would do more good at home. So he turned down the offer.
