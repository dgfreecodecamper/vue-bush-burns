# Members who became Ministers or Missionaries

The people of Glendermott are justly proud of the number of ministers and missionaries, who were brought up in the congregation. The record of the Corkey family is probably without equal anywhere. The three daughters of the late Rev Joseph Corkey M.A., L.L.D., became missionaries and the eight sons became ministers. In addition to these about twelve more ministers were brought up in the congregation, four of them being sons of the Manse.
