# Development of our Church Buildings

The present church was built in 1696 to accommodate 650 people. It was a barn church of typical Presbyterian design. The Ordinance Survey Memoirs record that it was enlarged in 1748 by Thomas Hogg, architect. They also record that, ‘above the entrance door in the middle of the southern front there is a sundial with this inscription: ‘The gift on Thomas Hogg to the congregation of Glandermod, anno domino 1748, William Hair, minister.’ This has disappeared, probably at the time the renovations were done to the Church in 1938.

It has not been possible to ascertain how the church was enlarged in 1748. As the original church was described as a barn church, i.e. rectangular, one could assume that the short middle aisle (which was extended to its present size in 1938) was added in 1748, and also possibly the galleries which covered three walls of the church and which could only be accessed from the outside steps. On the other hand, these galleries might have been the 1748 extension, as the original church was built for 650 people and this would have been difficult if there hadn’t been a centre aisle. No records of this extension can be found, so this piece of the building’s history remains uncertain.

The Ordinance Survey Memoirs also record that outside at the east aisle door, there is an inscription

    M I H 1696 ‘How Amiable Are Thy Tabernacles O Lord.<br>
    M. S. John Avery, 1696.’ <br>
    (most of this can still be seen)<br><br>

On the same gable but high up on the other side of the porch there is a slate tablet with the remains of the inscription ‘Rev William Hair 1747.’ This is difficult to see because it is painted over.

The next recorded account of any improvements to the church appears in the Minutes of a Session Meeting held on the 25th December 1835, where the following extract is found: ‘In the course of last year an entire new roof was put on the meeting house and the seats painted, solely at the expense of the Congregation excepting £20 received from the two county members : Captain Jones and Mr Robert Bateson – the amount about £110.’

Then in 1922 the Congregation decided to:

1. Do necessary repairs to 1st Glendermott Church inside and outside. To erect a ladies room.
2. Re-floor 2nd Glendermott Church to use as a Lecture Hall. Mr James Snodgrass was asked to use as much of the original timber as possible and to make a pew into a movable seat. This seat was examined at a later meeting and approved of, so Mr Snodgrass was then asked to convert the other pews in the same way, to serve as seating for the Hall.
3. To erect 2 memorial tablets. One as a memorial to the honour of those connected with the Congregation who served in the First World War 1914 -–1918. The other memorial tablet to the memory of the Rev James Gordon and Colonel Adam Murray. These two tablets occupy prominent positions on either side of the pulpit. The details of the inscriptions on these tablets are to be found on pages ???????

The only heating for the early church came from two large stoves. These stood in the middle of the East and West aisles and the flues leading from them went straight up through the roof space. These stoves were very popular for the ladies and the children to gather round before church on a chilly day. Some of the men preferred to gather either in the stables or under some of the large trees which grew where the car park is now, or even at the side of the road opposite the front gate of the church. The stables and sextons house which was built between 1840 and 1859, was demolished in 2002.

Before the advent of electricity, the lighting for the church was supplied by oil lamps placed on wall brackets. Later on electricity was produced by a generator. It did not operate very silently so it was a relief to those who sat near it when it was removed and the present lighting system was installed.

# Major Renovation Scheme

In 1938 when the Rev S.J. Wylie was minister, extensive renovations were undertaken – these being completed in 1939.

Before these alterations were made in 1938, the North Aisle (now called the Main Aisle) had been about one third the length of the present main aisle. The church had a gallery which covered three walls of the church. The only access to this gallery was from outside, where the congregation had to use stone steps. In 1938 these steps and galleries were all removed. New galleries for the East and West aisles were constructed and new porches were added to the original building to provide access to each gallery.

There was no gallery over the North Aisle – this was not added until 1961.

As part of the renovation scheme, the walls of the church were raised, the roof was removed and replaced, new spring doors were fitted, new flooring laid, the old pew doors were removed and a new pulpit was erected. In fact, except for the original walls, it was then a new church.

The cost of the renovations was £3,400. Of this amount, a sum of £1,000 was contributed by Messrs Robert and Alexander Henderson of Lisaghmore. The contractor was Mr S. Stewart and the architect Mr Ivan Lynch.

The following extracts are taken from a report of the re-opening and rededication service, printed in ‘The Londonderry Sentinel, Tuesday Morning February 28, 1939.’

‘Built by sturdy Ulster Presbyterian settlers, many of whom were Derry’s gallant defenders during the Siege, Glendermott Church in a valley of memories of heroic and devoted effort for the faith and the common Protestant heritage, was re-opened and rededicated on Sunday after extensive renovation and extension, which, while making it a beautiful and commodious place of worship, has preserved its ancient characteristics and appearance which have made the church a notable landmark in the valley.’

The Very Rev Dr William Corkey, son of the Rev Joseph Corkey, who had been minister in Second Glendermott for 50 years, gave the address, during which he compared the dark days of the Siege to those they were experiencing then and referring to the outbreak of the 1939 – 1945 World War II. The Sentinel quotes him as saying :

‘Our fathers never hesitated in God’s name to display their banners and maintain a testimony for God. It was when the Presbyterians in Scotland were suffering persecutions under the Stuarts that many of them left their native land for conscience sake 300 years ago and settled in these glens and through all these years the people have met in this valley for the public worship of God and the preaching of the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.’

‘There have been many dark days like those encountered during the Siege of Derry, but the people of Glendermott bore a brave part and have kept the faith and to-day this enlarged and restored church is a fresh declaration to all that in a world where God is being forgotten, you have no intention of joining with a multitude to do evil and that, whatever others may do, as for you and your households, you will serve the Lord.’

‘Let us make no mistake, the battle for freedom to worship God is being fought afresh today in Europe. The mightiest potentate in Europe to-day (Adolf Hitler) is demanding the absolute obedience of his subjects even in matters regarding their religious beliefs and many brave men are enduring hardships and imprisonment because they have dared to stand for the testimony of God. But Martin Niemuller in his cell is mightier than all the forces of Herr Hitler, because he has within him the presence of his God and Saviour.’

Concluding Dr Corkey said, ‘I need not tell you what joy it is to me, as representing a former generation of Glendermott members, to be present with you to-day and to see that all the old divisions of the past are gone for ever and that you are going forward in to the future one united congregation to carry on the work of the Lord in this place.’

# Later additions to the Church Building

1950 : A new War Memorial Tablet in memory of those who served in the World War 1939 – 1945, was unveiled and dedicated on 5th March 1950. The Officiating Ministers were Rev W Lyons Cochrane, M.C., B.A., C.F. and Rev William Knox B.A..

1961 :    A new gallery for the main aisle, costing about £1600 was built by J. Crawford & Sons. This addition was deemed necessary to cope with increasing membership due to the housing development in the area. A service of dedication was held on 18th June 1961, when Offertory Plates and a renovated Ladies Room were also dedicated.

The following stained glass windows were dedicated during the ministry of the Rev John McWhirter. These windows bear the following inscriptions:

# The Church Manses

It is known that the Rev John Will had access to the Parsonage until his ejection in 1665. However little is known as to the residences of our ministers until 1695, when Rev John Harvey was promised a house to live in.

The former First Glendermott Manse was let until 1933, when the congregation decided to sell it. It is known nowadays as Strathmore House.

Second Glendermott’s new manse was completed in 1870 and is the manse which has been used ever since the congregations reunited in 1911.

# The Church Halls

1950: Second Glendermott Church which was being used as a Church Hall was in poor condition in 1950. A committee of men, who saw to the running of it, worked voluntarily for weeks in the summer of that year to bring it up to date with the needs of that time, rendering it a very useful Church Hall for a number of years. When the new hall was built in 1971, the old hall was rented for commercial purposes.

1971: A new hall costing approximately £22,000 was opened on the 2nd September 1971, by Miss Adelaide Park, B.A.. The builder was J Crawford, Londonderry. A plaque in the entrance has the following inscription:

<div class="text-center">
    To the Glory of God<br>
    This stone was laid<br>
    by the<br>
    Rev. William Knox, B.A.<br>
    on the<br>
    3rd September, 1970.<br><br>
</div>

1980: A second hall, built by Snodgrass Brothers, was opened on the 27th September 1980. A plaque in the entrance hall bears the following inscription:

<div class="text-center"> 
    To the Glory of God<br>
    This stone was laid<br>
    by the<br>
    Rev. John McWhirter, B.A.<br>
    25th June, 1980.<br><br>
