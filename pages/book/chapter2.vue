# Glendermott and the Revival of 1859

Both congregations were effected for good by the Revival which swept through Ulster in 1859.

At the Session Meeting of First Glendermott on 16th February 1859, ‘it was resolved that the Session use their best endeavours to establish as many prayer meetings as possible throughout the congregation.’

The young minister of Second Glendermott, Rev Marshall Moore, was heavily involved in the Revival, taking a leading role in the public meetings which were frequently held to deal with people’s need for fellowship and counselling. He was a popular preacher and because of his zeal, travelled long distances on foot to preach at revival services. This took its toll on his health and he died while still a young man aged 30 years.

In his book ‘Memoirs of an Irish Manse,’ the late Dr. William Corkey, son of Dr. Joseph Corkey who succeeded the Rev Marshall Moore, mentions that when his father came to Glendermott in 1860, ‘the Revival spirit was still much in evidence and several young men belonging to the church, felt it their duty to come every Saturday night to join in prayer with my father so that they might together invoke God’s blessing on his preaching of the Gospel at the services the following day.’

During the Revival the churches had been filled to capacity. The whole area was affected and men were known to have left the harvest fields where they were working, to attend the Revival Church Meetings, singing hymns as they walked along the roads to the crowded church.

The minister of First Derry estimated that perhaps upwards of one hundred extra people were added to each Presbyterian congregation in the Derry area. This obviously brought new vitality and life to the worshipping people in the two Glendermott congregations.

As a result of the increased membership due to the 1859 Revival, it was necessary to consider establishing a new Presbyterian congregation in the Waterside area. With a view to this, the Rev McClure of First Derry and the Rev Corkey the new minister of Second Glendermott, presided over a meeting to discuss the establishment of another congregation. This resulted in the new congregation of Waterside being established in 1864, the Rev Corkey having organised the committee which led to the building of the church on Clooney Terrace.
