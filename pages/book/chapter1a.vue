# The History of Glendermott Presbyterian Church

History is about people – their fears, aspirations, beliefs and how they respond and adapt to whatever is happening around them. Therefore, before beginning a history of Glendermott Presbyterian Church, it is important, first of all, to consider the background history of Ireland, including both the social, political and religious developments which affected the whole of Britain and Ireland, and consequently the people of Glendermott too.

Just as today, there were power struggles between the Roman Catholic Church and the Church of England and between those who wanted independence for Ireland and those who wished to remain part of Britain. These struggles had been continuing during the 16th century and so at the beginning of the 17th century, the century when our congregation was founded, we find that the Established Church (the Church of England and the Church of Ireland) was the ruling power backed by the monarchy, and they were being challenged by the growing Presbyterian Church (the Dissenters) and the Roman Catholic Church also.

We therefore must look briefly at some major events which affected the development of our congregation in Glendermott – events such as O’Neills rebellion, the Flight of the Earls and the Plantation of Ulster which followed .

# O'Neills Rebellion and the Flight of the Earls

During the latter years of Elizabeth I’s reign, Hugh O’Neill, Earl of Tyrone headed a rebellion. By his diplomatic skill he had managed to unite under him most of the Chieftains of Ulster. His great victory at Yellow Ford over Bagenal brought practically all Ireland to his side. For a while he enjoyed success, but after Mountjoy was appointed Commander, fortune failed him and he made peace on favourable terms, retaining his title and lands. This happened at the very close of Elizabeth’s reign (1603).

James I (1603-1625), the new King of England favoured those who had been enemies of Elizabeth and so to the amazement of everybody and the disgust of the Chiefs who had remained loyal, O’Neill was reinstated in his former territorial rights. Within a short time, however, things changed. The Earl of Tyrone (O’Neill) was suspected of plotting a fresh rebellion. He was informed that he was about to be arrested and so he and the Earl of Tyrconnell, who was also suspected, fled in September 1607, never to return. Their flight was regarded as proof of their guilt. The flight of the Earls and the revolt of O’Doherty in 1608, opened the way to a wholesale confiscation of Ulster. Their lands were escheated (returned to the Crown) and James determined to colonize them with settlers from England and from lowland Scotland – with men who would be loyal and show an example of enterprise, industry and thrift. This was known as the Plantation of Ulster.

# The Plantation of Ulster

Nearly all the arable land in six counties – Donegal, Derry, Armagh, Antrim, Fermanagh and Cavan – about 750,000 English acres – were to be offered to settlers from England and Scotland, who in turn were to develop and improve the land.

The idea of the Plantation of Ulster seems to have originated with the Earl of Salisbury who endeavoured to settle Ulster with colonists whose energy and enterprise would improve the conditions of the country and its people, and who would be loyal to the Government in times of danger.

So a plan of settlement was drawn up by Lord Bacon and its execution was entrusted to Lord Deputy Chichester, who had a thorough knowledge of the country, of the manners and character of its inhabitants and of the wishes of the Chiefs.

Under the scheme, one half of each county was to be divided into lots of 1,000 acres and the other half into lots of 1,500 and 2,000 acres. The settlers were to be of three classes. The first group – called Undertakers were granted 2,000 acre lots. These Undertakers had to be English or Scots and they were to bring in tenants from England and Scotland.

The second group – Servitors – were people who had served the King already in any civil or military capacity. These Servitors received the 1,500 acre plots and they had to be English, Scots or Irish Protestants.

The third group received the 1,000 acre plots. They would be native Irish, who were to be free holders and were at liberty to plant with Irish settlers of any religious denomination.

# The Plantation of the Faughan Valley

The citizens of London undertook the colonization of the County of Londonderry and on the 29th of March, 1613, King James granted a charter to “The Society of the Governor and Assistants of London, of the New Plantation in Ulster, within the Realm of Ireland.” On the 17th December 1613, the estates granted to the Irish Society were divided into twelve parts, and a part of the County of Londonderry was given to each of the twelve principal London Companies, which were Mercers, Grocers, Drapers, Fishmongers, Goldsmiths, Skinners, Merchant Taylors, Haberdashers, Salters, Ironmongers, Vintners, Clothworkers.

The Goldsmith’s Company’s Portion of land included the Parish of Glendermott, for which they paid £3,333 6s 8d. Settlers from Scotland came as tenants to Glendermott in large numbers in the first half of the 17th century. Because of this influx of Scots, the dialect spoken in the Valley was Lowland Scotch and to some extent remains today in many areas. Little is known of their history previous to 1654. There can be no doubt however that many from Glendermott took the Covenant in 1644, when it was solemnly administered by Messrs Adair and Weir, in “the great church (Derry Cathedral) to the Citizens of Derry and a great multitude” from the country, “ the Altar being removed to give place to the Lord’s table.”

# Contention between The Church of Ireland and Presbyterian Dissenters

At the time of the Ulster Plantation, the Irish Established Church (the Church of Ireland) has as its Primate, James Ussher. He had been taught in his youth by a Presbyterian tutor and studied at Trinity College Dublin, which then had a Presbyterian Provost at its head. The standards of the Established Church, adopted in 1615, were not the present 39 Articles of the Anglican Communion, but Articles which were so acceptable to Presbyterians that they actually contributed more than any other document to the Confession of Faith and the Catechisms of the Westminster Assembly of Divines. In these, the necessity of Episcopal ordination (i.e. recognizing the governing order of bishops) is not mentioned, nor the existence of three orders of Bishops, Priests and Deacons. When, therefore, Brice and other Presbyterian ministers came over to Ulster after the Scottish settlers, they were admitted to the Ministry of the Parish Churches without Episcopal ordination, received the tithes, conducted services as they did in the Church of Scotland and were recognised by the Bishops of the Diocese in which they laboured. This promising union, however, did not last long.

Charles I succeeded James in 1625 and remained King of England until he was executed by Cromwell in 1649. Charles was influenced by the intolerant William Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury, who was then directing ecclesiastical policy in England. His influence was also sought by some of the Irish bishops to secure the expulsion from Irish Parish Churches, of the Presbyterian Ministers previously admitted. An order was procured from King Charles to depose them and Ussher was powerless. Thomas Wentworth (Earl of Strafford) a faithful servant of Charles, was Governor of Ireland, and he forced this policy through. So dark became the outlook for Presbyterians in Ulster that many thought of seeking a refuge across the ocean in America and Canada and in 1636 the ‘Eagle Wing’ set sail. But storms drove the ship back to Carrickfergus. Strenuous efforts were made to stamp out Presbyterianism and many were committed to gaol. They were ordered to take the ‘Black Oath’ by which they were required to swear that they would never oppose anything the King might command and that they renounced and retracted the Covenant which in 1638, had been entered into by their kinsfolk in Scotland. Great numbers refused. Many were arrested, chained and committed to gaols. Heavy fines were inflicted and Wentworth declared his intention of persecuting all who refused the oath ‘to the blood’ and of driving them ‘root and branch’ out of the Kingdom. Women, as well as men, were arrested. But Wentworth’s day of glory came to an end. He was executed after impeachment by the English Parliament, and Laud later lost his head by the axe.

Then came the ferocious massacre of 1641, perpetrated by the native Irish, led by Sir Felim O’Neill and marked by fiendish treachery and barbarous cruelty, one of its objects was the complete removal of Protestantism from Ireland and the establishment of Romanism in its place.

At first the Scots were immune but later were treated as part of the enemy. Modern historians consider that there was considerable bloodshed and suffering and have estimated the number of casualties among settlers as some 4,000 killed and 8,000 dying of exposure and disease following the rising. Between a third and a half of these would have been Presbyterians.

A Scots army was sent over in 1642 to protect the Protestant settlers in Ulster. This army had its headquarters in Carrickfergus. The regiments were accompanied by their Chaplains and they established Kirk Sessions. Four of these Chaplains with representative Elders, constituted the first regular Presbytery ever held in Ireland and so the modern Irish Presbyterian Church dates its formal history from 1642. Applications for ministers came in from neighbouring parishes, for the massacre and rebellion had swept out most Protestant clergy from the country. Petitions were sent to the Church of Scotland, asking for men and ministers to be sent over for temporary duty for several churches. Once again, with the defeat of the Irish rebels and the establishment of the Commonwealth (1649-1653) under Oliver Cromwell, many Presbyterian ministers occupied Parish Churches and conducted worship in Presbyterian fashion.

But Cromwell had, naturally, no love for Irish Presbyterians for they had opposed the execution of King Charles I of the House of Stuart. Presbyterians also refused to take the Engagement Oath, renouncing all allegiance to the Stuart line. So Cromwell arrested and imprisoned many and in the end ordered them to leave the Kingdom. Baptist and Independent ministers were brought over from England to occupy vacant pulpits. But the Presbyterians stood by their ‘outed’ ministers and worshipped in lonely fields and glens by the light of the moon and the stars.

It is believed that Glendermott’s first church was secluded and was situated about a quarter of a mile from the present Church. Older residents have recalled their forefathers speaking of a site near a ‘variegated sycamore tree’, where large stones used to be visible in a meadow – leading to the idea that these stones once formed the walls of this underground secret meeting-place.

At length Cromwell yielded. The persecution ceased and Presbyterianism slowly gathered strength again and its congregations multiplied. A government endowment was given to the Church and soon there were some eighty congregations and at least sixty ministers under a General Presbytery or Synod.

# Establishment of Glendermott Congregation

It was during these prosperous days of 1654 that Glendermott congregation had its first minister – John Will. In 1660 he was listed as a curate and officiated in the Parish Church of Glendermott which was in those days built within the walls of the old graveyard in the Glen – sometimes called  The Ivy Church. John Will earned £80 a year, received the tithes and occupied the parsonage house up to 1665.

But these ‘summer days’ were soon to pass and when Charles II was restored to the English throne in 1660, Prelacy (i.e. the order of Bishops), was re-established in Ireland and all Presbyterian ministers were ordered to conform to episcopacy or be evicted from the Parish Churches. Meetings of Presbyterians were forbidden and Dragoons were sent out to break them up. Of sixty-eight Presbyterian ministers occupying Parish churches, sixty-one refused to conform and were ejected. John Will was ejected and he was followed by his people. The usual steps were taken to extirpate Presbyterianism. Bishop Leslie of Raphoe first excommunicated and then imprisoned, on his own warrant, four Presbyterian ministers : John Hart of Taughboyne, Thomas Drummond of Ramelton, William Semple of Letterkenny and Adam White of Fannet. They were kept in confinement for six years.

Yet the Bush still burned, but was not consumed. Friendly farmers gave their barns for secret worship and in defiance of all the Bishop’s threats and punishments, the Lord’s Supper was observed. Gradually the storm abated. About 1668 they began to build humble places of worship and the English Government grew more averse to their persecution. Sporadic attempts were made by some of the bishops to renew it and about 1684 some churches were forcibly closed, preaching prohibited and fines imposed on those ministers who would not use the Prayer Book.

With the accession of the Catholic King James II in 1685 begins a period of history which is familiar to all because of the Siege of Derry and the Battle of the Boyne. James attempted to make Roman Catholicism the national religion but failed. The revolution of 1689 saw James being replaced by William III and because of his influence the ‘Regium Donum’, and annual grant of £1200, was given to the Presbyterian Church in Ireland. The Regium Donum was used to augment a ministers income, since many congregations were unable to offer a stipend large enough to sustain a minister and his family. But in spite of William’s earnest personal desire for legal toleration, the infamous Test Act still debarred Presbyterians from any public office or from membership of Corporations. The Irish bishops bitterly opposed every attempt to establish equality or to legalise Presbyterian worship. However there was an ever-growing reluctance on the part of the English government to support extreme measures.

Queen Anne replaced William III on the English throne and she proved to be no friend to Presbyterians. In 1704, during her reign, the Test act was placed on the Statute Book. This Act laid it down that all persons holding any public appointment must take Communion in an Episcopal Church within three months after appointment, or lose their office. In the city of Derry, of the twelve Aldermen, ten were Presbyterian and they were turned out. Of the twenty-four Burgesses, fourteen were Presbyterians and were expelled. In Belfast the nine Burgesses forfeited their seats. It was a ploy to prohibit Presbyterians from areas of power.

This Test Act contributed to a fall in Presbyterian numbers and the Act was not repealed until 1780. Landlords and bishops used their influence in the Irish Parliament to prevent any improvement in the legal position of Presbyterians. Difficulties were put in the way of building Meeting-houses. Presbyterian ministers were deprived of the right to solemnise marriage. Such marriages were stigmatised as invalid, the partners described as living in sin and the children classified as illegitimate.

It was not until 1842 that an Act was passed, confirming the validity of marriages celebrated by dissenting ministers. As well as this, everyone had to pay tithes to the Established Church.

For these reasons emigration among Presbyterians in the eighteenth century was significant. One calculation is that at least 100,000 and possibly as many as 250,000, left Ulster to settle in North America in the period leading up to the American War of Independence. By the end of the 1700’s about one sixth of the white U.S. population claimed to be of Scots-Irish descent.

These years of strife between the Church of Ireland and the Presbyterians seen so unbelievable when we consider the good relations which exist to-day. However we must consider that in those times neither Church believed in tolerance. Each Church held extremely strong views that only their way of worship was correct and anything else had to be prevented.

History does show that whichever Church held power, they did so with extreme strictness – demanding everyone else to practise as they did. There was, unfortunately, little adherence to Christ’s command “that we love one another”.

Therefore we should not assume that the Presbyterian Church would have shown any more tolerance to their Church of Ireland neighbours, had they had the power of the monarch and Parliament behind them.
