# Conslusion

As I conclude this short history of Glendermott Presbyterian Church, I have tried to document all the significant episodes in our congregation’s past, when developments to our buildings, property and forms of worship occurred. Mention has also been made of periods of historical importance and of material contribution to our church. Importance has been attached to all of our ministers who have served the congregation faithfully through the years and we are grateful to Almighty God for their service.

However I have failed to include the tremendous contribution which must have been made by the lay people – the ordinary congregation members who gave of themselves in the past.

In my own time growing up in the congregation, I can remember with respect and gratitude all those men and women who carried the burden and responsibilities of the church upon their shoulders. If I were to mention people like W.J. Hyndman, Joseph Goligher, John Snodgrass, Jim and Annie Miller, Willie Heaney, I would be just scratching the surface as there are many others who are also worthy of mention.

It is unfortunate therefore that many of the church’s records have gone missing, as they would have given us information of all those worthy people in the past decades who served the church and the community sometimes as effectively as their ordained ministers.

The Church is not a building, it is a body of people, and Glendermott has been blessed with many wonderful men and women during the past 350 years, and we are still being blessed by the quality of those fine men and women who carry the responsibility of furthering Christ’s Kingdom in Glendermott today. May God grant them the wisdom they require to lead our congregation forward with the same reverence and respect for the Word of God, as our forefathers had.
