# The Kirk Sessions of Glendermott

Every Kirk Session is referred to as a court of the Church and when one examines some of the Minutes of Session Meetings, they do illustrate the fact that Sessions were called upon to deal with problems which would nowadays be the business of a Magistrates Court.

Many of the minute books contain accounts of disputes between members of congregation, as it was the right of one member of congregation to bring another member before the Session to answer to some alleged wrong doing. The Session then had to give a ruling and attempt to patch up quarrels and differences. Thus the Session was occasionally asked to see that debts were paid, to settle disputes over legacies, deal with drunk and disorderly charges etc.

The Session was therefore expected to handle quite a range of offences ranging from petty quarrels to those of a more serious nature. The punishment for those found guilty of a serious offence was usually the withdrawal from full membership of the Church – the refusal of the Church’s Sacraments. These privileges were not restored until the guilty party appeared before the whole congregation to admit his or her guilt and promise repentance. This must have been a very painful humiliating punishment.

It is unfortunate that many Kirk Session books belonging to congregations have been lost, as this denies us the intimate knowledge of the internal affairs of the congregation over many years. However in some ways this is not altogether to be regretted, for in the books that have been preserved, there are recorded examples of human frailty. These unfortunate sinners, even though they had submitted themselves to severe discipline and public humiliation which was then the custom and even though they promised repentance, yet their deeds were permanently recorded in the Session Minutes. They were therefore placed in the ‘seat of shame’ for all time which was hardly the most Christian way of dealing with it.

Generally most of the Session’s meetings were to do with looking after ‘the Poor’s Money.’ And in answering queries each year on the ‘state of religion’ in the church.

Here are a few examples of the varied topics which had to be dealt with by the Glendermott Kirk Session.

**1835:** The Communion was changed form once a year to twice – April and October.

**July 1842:** Called the Rev Alexander Buchanan, offering a stipend of £65.

**December 1842:** Increased this stipend by ‘3d in the 1/=’ three pence in the shilling = 25%. This was because the Minister could not afford to keep his family with the stipend previously offered.

**1847:** A notice from Committee to Session that there were arrears of £32 in paying Stipend – some seat holders were not paying. The Session threatened to make public a list of non-payers if not settled before Communion. Session decided to summon the guilty seat holders who were able to pay but were still defaulting. They were going to be refused Communion tokens when they were being handed out on the Thursday and Saturday before Communion Sunday.

**1848:** Each elder was asked to catechise in the district – preparing young people for Communion.

**1853:** Intending Communicants who had attended the Sabbath School’s Examination during the half year ending April 7th 1853, should receive their tokens.

**1856:** Joseph D. expressed regret that he had accepted Communion in Second Glendermott without a Certificate from First Glendermott Session – Certificate granted.

**1856:** Elisa Mc was accused by Alexander S of milking his cow during June and July. A witness, Nancy E, stated that on June 2nd, she requested Elisa Mc to make her some tea. Alexander S. was present and enquired had they any milk. When Elisa said she hadn’t, he took a cup, milked his own cow and gave the milk to them. He then asked if she usually had no milk for the tea and when she said she hadn’t, he told her never to want as long as his cow was on the grass. The Session decided that as Alexander S. had directed Elisa Mc to milk the cow, that no crime had been committed.

**1858:** A couple appeared before Session requesting Baptism for a child. After questioning, Baptism was granted.

Finally, it is interesting to note the number of Communicants recorded in the Session Minutes.
