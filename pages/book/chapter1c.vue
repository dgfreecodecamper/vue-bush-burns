# First Glendermott's Ministers

#### Willaim Haire (Hair) 1743 - 1767
He had the unenviable task of settling a congregation which had just parted company with many friends and neighbours whom they had worked and worshipped with for years. After a ministry of twenty-four years, Mr Haire died in 1767 and again there was a long vacancy and much division.

The congregation was divided into two parts over who should be Mr Haire’s successor. The Rev Thomas Hamilton, a Licentiate of the Derry Presbytery commanded the support of one section, but a much larger and more influential part of the congregation asked the Presbytery to appoint the Rev James Knox, a Licentiate of the Letterkenny Presbytery. There seems to have been a very bitter feeling between the two parties. Mr Hamilton’s supporters seized the church building against the orders of the Presbytery, but the Presbytery brought about their ejection and the Rev James Knox was ordained as minister of First Glendermott on 1770.

#### Founding of Faughanbridge Reformed Presbyterian Church

The Rev Thomas Hamilton, with some of his supporters then joined with some Covenanters who had been attending the Covenanters Meeting House at Bready from 1766. In 1770 they established the Reformed Presbyterian Church at Faughan Bridge and Mr Hamilton was their minister. A new church building to hold 300 people was opened in 1786.

#### James Knox 1770 - 1798
Rev James Knox had once again to settle the congregation after yet another dispute, which he did with great success. After a ministry of twenty-eight years, Mr Knox resigned because of infirmity in 1798, the year of the Irish Rebellion. He had been born near Raphoe in 1738 and died unmarried in November1813.

#### William Monteith 1800 - 1841
The Rev James Knox was succeeded by the Rev William Monteith, a native of Urney, Co. Tyrone. He was educated at Strabane Academy and was a Licentiate of the Letterkenny Presbytery. He was ordained in December 2nd 1800. The Rev William Monteith’s son the Rev John Monteith was the first minister of Donemana.

The Rev William Monteith retired in 1841 and died in 1849.

#### Alexander Buchanan 1842 - 1871
The Rev Alexander Buchanan, a Licentiate of the Letterkenny Presbytery, had been ordained in 1842 as assistant to Mr Monteith who had become infirm and therefore Mr Buchanan succeeded him. It is recorded of him that ‘he was a popular preacher and met with great acceptance wherever he went.’ Mr Buchanan died in 1871 and was succeeded by the Rev Thomas Thompson.

#### Thomas Thompson 1872 - 1910
The Rev Thomas Thompson, a Licentiate of the Coleraine  Presbytery, had supplied the congregation from September 1870 for the Presbytery and the Session and was ordained as minister of First Glendermott in January 1872. It is said of him that ‘he was a capable man of business and took a prominent part in the proceedings of the various Church courts. He was a firm believer in the excellence of the old paths.’

He may have lived for a short while across the Burngibbagh River in a house which has since been demolished to make way for the estate of Ivy Mead. He is reported to have walked up to the Glebe to baptise a child and he said that he had crossed the burn as a short cut. This may have occurred while he was acting as supply, with the manse still being occupied by the senior minister, the Rev Buchanan.

The Rev Thompson served his God faithfully during his time and he was the last minister of First Glendermott before its re-unification with Second Glendermott in 1911. He was given the title of Minister Emeritus of the United Congregations. He died in June 1916 and he was the first to be buried in our church’s cemetery. The second funeral was that of James Thompson Miller (Sen.) who had served the church faithfully as an elder and whose son, of the same name, also served as an elder for many years until his death, as did all the family.

# The Ministers of Second Glendermott

Second Glendermott was annexed to the Route Presbytery for a time, but afterwards to Letterkenny Presbytery.

#### The First Minister - John Holmes 1744 - 1773
The Rev John Holmes, a Licentiate of Lanark Presbytery, was installed on 19th April 1744. Being the first minister of Second Glendermott, he had the responsibility of building the first church and as well as settling a congregation after an unpleasant division. However Mr Holmes proved he was capable and the new church was erected at the crossroads near First Glendermott and was completed in 1744. Mr Holmes’ name appears on a tablet at the front of the building. This building was used as a church hall after the reunification of the two churches, but is used for commercial purposes now. Rev Holmes died in 1773 and was succeeded by the Rev Henry Miller M.A.

#### Henry Miller 1776 - 1814
The Rev Miller was a native of Ballymena. He was educated in Glasgow, licensed in Ballymena and was ordained in Second Glendermott in 1776. After becoming infirm, he retired in 1814 and died in Malin in 1821.

#### Henry Carson 1816 - 1854
Mr Miller was succeeded by the Rev Henry Carson M.A., a native of Clogher, Co. Tyrone and a graduate of Glasgow University. Mr Carson had been Mr Miller’s assistant from 1815 and was ordained as minister of Second Glendermott in 1816. He married Miss Henderson of Dungiven and after a long ministry of thirty-eight years, retired in 1854. He died in 1870. The Rev H.H. Carson, minister of Ballyweany , was a son.

#### Marshall Moore 1855 - 1860
Mr Carson was succeeded by the Rev. Marshall Moore, son of the minister of Faughanvale and son-in-law of the famous Rev, James Elder of Finvoy. Mr Moore had been appointed assistant to Mr Carson when the latter’s health declined, but was ordained as his successor on 3rd April 1855. After a brief ministry of only five years, he died in 1860. A Tablet to his memory was erected on the Second Church.

#### Joseph Corkey 1860 - 1910
On the 27th September 1860 there was begun a ministry which was destined to wield an immeasurable influence in Glendermott and far beyond it. The Rev Joseph Corkey, M.A., LL.D., from Co. Armagh, a Licentiate of Belfast Presbytery, was ordained in Second Glendermott in 1860. He was a man of considerable ability and after a brilliant LL.B. course was appointed Barrington Lecturer in Law at Queen’s University, Belfast. He married Isabella Sloane of Edinburgh in 1866.

He left the Church a great legacy. Firstly in terms of his offspring. He had eleven children and the eight boys were all ordained as Presbyterian ministers, while the three girls all did missionary service. Secondly Joseph Corkey was largely responsible for the removing of alcohol from the Communion cup. He zealously advocated total abstinence and as Editor of ‘The Christian Banner’ for sixteen years, he wrote many articles, books and pamphlets on the subject. It is recorded of him that, ‘it was largely through his influence that the intoxicating cup was banished from the Lord’s Table in the Presbyterian Church. In the cause of total abstinence he was a pioneer and continued throughout his life an uncompromising advocate of its principles.’ One of his best known publications was entitled, ‘The Battle With Alcohol And How To Win It.’

Joseph Corkey also joined the controversy about Instrumental Music, opposing changes which were being introduced in to the praise service. He criticised the contents of the new Hymnary, which led to the General Assembly producing the Revised Edition of the Church Hymnary.

When he first came to Glendermott he had to rent a house in the Waterside. This must have been a considerable drain on his meagre income. His stipend was only £70 per annum and he received only part of the Regium Donum, since the senior minister, Rev Carson, was still alive and therefore entitled to some of it. When he married in 1866 he had to bring his young bride to this house as the new manse was not completed until 1870.

Even then, Mr Corkey was forbidden the use of it unless he signed a document which would bind him to vacate the Manse when he retired from the active duties of the ministry, which would have been contrary to the Law of the Assembly. Mr Corkey refused to sign and so the committee refused to let him live in the manse. They also withheld the final payment to the builder, who held on to the keys of the manse. It was finally resolved when some generous number of the congregation paid the builder, received the keys and handed them over to Mr Corkey, who along with his wife and child occupied the new manse in July 1870.

At his death in 1910, the Rev Thomas Thompson, minister of First Glendermott, retired, and the two congregations were happily re-united after a separation of 167 years.

# Ministers of the Re-United Church

#### William Alexander Park, B.A., B.D. 1911 - 1930
When both congregations became vacant in 1910, a union of the two was happily effected and the Rev William Park was called to the united charge. He had been Principal of Castlederg Intermediate School and was then licensed by the Omagh Presbytery and ordained in Newtowncunningham. From there he was installed in Glendermott on 18th August 1911. He married Caroline Alice, the daughter of the Rev Samuel Black of Corrick. Their illustrious family gave the Church three outstanding minsters – Samuel James (minister of Dunlaoghaire), William Alexander Albert (minister of Ballygilbert) and John Ferguson (minister of Stormont). They all became Doctors of Divinity and were important figures in the General Assembly. The first two became Moderators of the Assembly in 1965 and 1961 respectively.

Rev. Park’s self-effacing zeal and systematic discharge of all his duties did much to cement the union which had been effected. One can only imagine how different the task must have seemed. Rev Thomas Thompson had been minister of First Glendermott for 38 years and Dr Joseph Corkey had ministered in Second Glendermott for 50 years. They were both good men of strong character and convictions, individualistic and independent in outlook. Naturally they stamped something of themselves upon their congregations. It was Mr Park’s task to unite these two congregations and he did it. By his discretion, his wisdom, his ability to say nothing when that was the best thing to do and by his greatness of heart, he welded these two congregations together. The fruits of his labours and those of his successors remain, in the harmony and prosperity which have since distinguished the congregation.

Mr Park died in 1930.

The following is the terms of union which were drawn up when the two congregations re-united in 1911.

# First and Second Glendermott - Terms of Union

A Commission appointed by the General Assembly to deal with the union of First and Second Glendermott congregations drew up the following terms of union:

1.    That the union of First and Second Glendermott congregations be and it is hereby confirmed and that the name of the united congregation be First and Second Glendermott.

2.    That the members of the Kirk Sessions of First Glendermott congregation an d Second Glendermott congregation be members of the Kirk Session of the united congregation.

3.    That the members of the Committees of First Glendermott congregation and Second Glendermott congregation be members of the Committee of the united congregation until the united congregation shall elect and appoint a Committee in a regular way, which shall be done before the close of the present year.

4.    That the Sabbath morning service be held in the First Glendermott Church and that the place and hour of the Sabbath evening service be determined by the Kirk Session of the united congregation.

5.    That the existing trust funds and other trust property for the benefit of First Glendermott and Second Glendermott congregations be held on similar trusts for the benefit of the united congregation and that, if necessary, steps be taken to secure that this can be legally done.

6.    That the minister of the united congregation shall have the right to occupy and use the Manse and Manse farm which he prefers and shall receive the profit income arising from the letting or sale of the other Manse and Manse farm.

19th August 1920<br>
James McGranahan<br>
Convenor

#### Samuel James Wylie B.A. 1931 - 1947
In February 1931, the Rev S.J. Wylie, B.A., a Licentiate of the Belfast Presbytery and minister of Second Dunboe, received a Call and was installed on 29th January 1931. His eloquence and originality as a preacher, coupled with his spirit of friendliness and geniality will long be remembered by the people of Glendermott. He established himself as a preacher of outstanding ability and he published a volume of sermons entitled ‘Glendermott Mornings’. He resigned in March 1947, having accepted a Call to Whiteabbey. It was during his ministry that the main aisle was extended and the church received extensive renovation.

#### William Knox B.A. 1947 - 1973
Mr Wylie was followed by the Rev William Knox B.A., a Licentiate of the Ballymena Presbytery  and minister of the united charge of Ballygawley and Ballyreagh, Co. Tyrone. His quietly effective ministry was very much appreciated by his congregation. He saw a fine hall erected and a new pipe organ installed. He resigned on 30th June 1973 and retired to live in Powfoot, Annan, Dumfriesshire. He died in December 2001.

During Mr Knox’s ministry, at a Congregational Meeting on  26th February 1950, 1st and 2nd Glendermott changed its name to Glendermott. The final chapter was therefore written in the re-unification of the two congregations.

#### John McWhirter B.A., M.TH. 1974 - 1991
The Rev John Mc Whirter, a Ballymena man and a Licentiate of Ballymena Presbytery, was installed on the 19th September 1974. Mr McWhirter had spent nine years as minister of Orritor and Claggan. During his ministry Glendermott congregation grew in numbers, partly because of the movement of population from the city of Londonderry to escape the civil unrest there. Because of this increase in membership, it was considered necessary to provide Mr McWhirter with extra help, so the following assistants were appointed and spent some time working in the congregation – some for a year and some for a few months. These assistants were: Alastair Bill, Keith Duddy and Stewart Jones. Then in September 1987, Miss Patricia Shirley was appointed Deaconess and served the congregation faithfully until 1996, when she was called to Greystone Road Presbyterian Church, Antrim.

A second new hall was opened and five new stained-glass windows were dedicated during Rev McWhirter’s ministry. He retired in 1991 and lived in Eglinton where he died in February 2004.

#### Kenneth George Patterson B.A., DIP. TH. 1992 - 2004
The Rev Kenneth Patterson from Portadown, was a Licentiate of the Armagh Presbytery. He had been assistant in Mourne, Kilkeel before becoming minister of Rasharkin, until his installation in Glendermott on the 11th December 1992. During his ministry two assistants came to serve in the congregation – they were Lee Eagleson and Sam Castles. Mr. Patterson resigned on the 5th December 2004.
