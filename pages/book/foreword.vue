# Foreword

The Bible speaks of the Church of Jesus Christ as being glorious. Amongst other titles, the Church is described as the 'body of Christ', the 'building of Christ' and the 'bride of Christ'. Essentially the Church is made up of the people of God who have been *'called out of darkness into the wonderful light'* (1 Peter 2:9). That being the case the Church of Jesus Christ must be glorious. Yet when we look at the Church, either in history or presently, the glory so often is thickly veiled. Michael Griffriths in the Introduction to his book entitled, 'Cinderella with Amnesia' writes, *'The Bible talks about the bride of Christ but the Church today seems like a ragged Cinderella, hideous amongst the ashes. She has forgotten that she is supposed to be growing up to be a beautiful lady'.* So often there is a gap between what we are meant to be and what we really are.

The purpose of this book is twofold. Firstly to retrace the steps of the work of God over 350 years since the Church was established back in 1654. It is a grand story of how, in spite of numerous and various difficulties, God was at work in calling a people out for himself. There were times when the light of the Gospel shone brightly: there were other times when the light was rather dim. Yet God was building his Church.

Secondly it is written for our encouragement. The author of Psalm 77 recalls the past deeds of God in order to find encouragement in days when it appeared that God had, 'forgotten to be merciful'. We live in a day of small things when it appears that the Gospel light is being threated with extinction and it would be so easy to become disheartened. This history, carefully researched and written by Ryan Donaghey, is clearly an encouragement to believe that God works out everything according to his own plan and purpose.

I trust you will be encouraged as you read this book of God's dealings in Glendermott valley and that you will therefore continue to give, *'yourself fully to the work of the Lord because you know that your labour in the Lord is not in vain'.*

Rev K. G. Patterson
(Minister of Glendermott - 1992-2004)
