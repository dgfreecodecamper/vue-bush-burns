# Rev. J. Gordon & Col. Adam Murray Memorial Tablet

<div class="text-center"> 
This Tablet<br>
is<br>
Erected to the Memory of the<br>
Revd. James Gordon<br>
Third Minister of Glendermott<br>
in acknowledgement of<br>
and as<br>
a testimony to his great services<br>
to the cause of<br>
truth and freedom<br>
through rousing to resolute resistance<br>
the parishioners and kinsmen<br>
and through<br>
his efforts afterwards in urging Kirke<br>
to relieve the Maiden City in 1689<br>
and of<br>
Colonel Adam Murray of Ling<br>
a Member of this Congregation<br>
whose timely and fearless action<br>
prevented the surrender of the City<br>
and whose<br>
unflinching bravery and unshaken faith<br>
were an ever present incentive<br>
to that heroic endurance and steadfastness<br>
which under God saved the City;<br>
And in gratitude to God for raising up<br>
and sustaining heroic men and leaders<br>
and for<br>
working through them a great deliverance.<br><br>

“God is our refuge and our strength<br>
In straits a present aid,<br>
Therefore although the earth remove<br>
We will not be afraid.”<br>
