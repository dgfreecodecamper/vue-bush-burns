# The Home coming

Written by the Rev Alexander Corkey in commemoration of the re-union of Rev Joseph Corkey and his eight preacher sons at Glendermott Manse, September 1908.

<div class="text-center">
The years have glided swiftly<br>
Since we parted one by one;<br>
And left the happy scenes of youth<br>
When training years were done.<br><br>

Some had crossed with mighty ocean,<br>
And had travelled far and wide;<br>
All busy as ambassadors,<br>
Teaching Christ the crucified.<br><br>

But a longing for the old home<br>
Came amid the toil of life;<br>
And we planned a grand home-coming<br>
And a rest from every strife.<br><br>

We came with happy joyful hearts,<br>
Eight brothers all were there;<br>
And ‘neath the old homes sheltering roof<br>
We bowed in thankful prayer.<br><br>

The honoured Father still in strength<br>
Welcomed his sons with love,<br>
And Mother’s joy was full, I ween,<br>
Though now she lives above.<br><br>

What glad handshakes, what greeting gay,<br>
What hours of rest and joy,<br>
The preacher sons are young again,<br>
Each feels himself a boy.<br><br>

And so me thinks when life is done,<br>
And in that home above<br>
We’ll meet in joyful companies<br>
With gladness, praise and love.<br><br>

Our Father there will greet us<br>
On that fair Heavenly shore,<br>
And we, his well-loved children,<br>
Shall rest, all journeys o’er.<br><br>
